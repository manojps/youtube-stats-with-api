# Scrap YouTube Video Stats Using Official API

This project was part of a pet project I did to analyze Bangla content viewership on YouTube. My approach was pretty simple. I searched different categories of Bangla content using the API and then collected the stats from the first ~450 videos.

The report and infographic I created using this data can be found at http://alo.ventures/what-are-bengalis-watching-on-youtube/
